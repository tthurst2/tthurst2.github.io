Version 1.03:

Implemented a fourth weapon, with delayed bullet instantiation on death(a "bomb").

Added a basic hard-coded UI using the Unity UI system to display the weapon switching of keys 1-4.

Generally optomized prefab storage with the inventory object singleton.

HotFix: WeaponPane bug fixed to correct vertical height in different aspect ratios
